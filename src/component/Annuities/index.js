                <AnnuityP> Annuities are contractual payment(s) obligations between you and an insurance company for the purpose to save your money and incrementally withdraw it during retirement, effectively giving you a fixed income indefinitely. Payouts are then given by the insurance company monthly. 
Generally, more interest is gained the longer your contract is with the insurance company.
A benefit from annuity contracts is that there are no contribution limits unlike 401(k)s or IRAs where they have a limit to how much you can contribute.
